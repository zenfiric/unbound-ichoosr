When assigning a registration whose ZIP code falls within the service area of multiple suppliers, you should: 
- Address Skew Consideration: Recognize that the connection between registration addresses and suppliers' service areas can skew distribution.
  Adjust allocations based on relative (not absolute) distribution to ensure balanced distributions.
- Relative Distribution Measurement: Assess distribution by comparing each supplier's capacity to the number of registrations assigned, using the supplier capacity dataset.
  Based on this prioritise the relative distrubtion over the absolute distribution numbers. 
- Make sure to consistently check if the relative distribution has changed or not. 

Example: If Supplier A can serve 100 registrations and Supplier B can serve 200, Supplier A should receive about 33% of registrations.
If Supplier A has 80 registrations and Supplier B has 100, Supplier A's relative assignment is 80%, and Supplier B's is 50%.
Despite fewer absolute registrations, Supplier A has a higher relative percentage. Thus, prioritize Supplier B when allocating registrations in overlapping service areas.
