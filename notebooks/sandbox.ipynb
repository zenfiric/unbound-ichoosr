      "### Step-by-Step Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Matching by ZIP Code**:\n",
      "   - The registration ZIP code is `55409`.\n",
      "   - Based on the offers, the suppliers serving `55409` are:\n",
      "     - All Energy Solar (servicing ZIPs range including `55409`)\n",
      "     - iSolar (servicing ZIPs range including `55409`)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Supplier Capacity**:\n",
      "   - All Energy Solar: Capacity of 100.\n",
      "   - iSolar: Capacity of 100.\n",
      "   - TruNorthSolar is not applicable for `55409` as it does not service this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Product Needs (Panels)**:\n",
      "   - The registered campaign requires panels.\n",
      "   - Specific match on products:\n",
      "     - All Energy Solar: Offers \"Jinko 425\" panels.\n",
      "     - iSolar: Offers \"Silfab HG\" panels.\n",
      "     - TruNorthSolar offers panels, but does not service this ZIP.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Distribution According to <distribution_rules>**:\n",
      "   - Both All Energy Solar and iSolar have equal capacity but may have differences in relative distribution.\n",
      "   - If either supplier has more registrations fulfilled, preference goes to the other supplier to balance the distribution relatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Review Needed for Match Assignment\n",
      "Based on given information, both All Energy Solar and iSolar meet the requirements equally. We should move forward with an assignment decision based on existing distribution data, ensuring no skewed loads.\n",

      "- Ensure the distribution between overlapping suppliers follows the relative capacity rule.\n",
      "- Consider if a current or previous assignment data for these suppliers is causing a skew.\n",
